This is an Android app I created mostly for fun but it served a functional purpose as well. At the end of a serving shift,
I input my net sales, percent I need to tip out, and how much money either the house owes me or I owe them. From that  
Information it calculates my total payout as well as the amount I need to leave as a tipout for the bussers/hosts.
